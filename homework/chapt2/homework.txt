2.4 exercise
1
(a) flexible. There are many (n is large) training sets of data, so don't need to worry flexible method will lead to a overfitting model.
(b) inflexible. Small number observation will be over fitted using flexible method.
(c) flexible. Linear relation is very inflexible.
(d) inflexible. The built-in variance of predictor is very high, so flexible method will add more variance based on a non-stable data.
2. n is the number of training data sets, p is the size of one predictor
(a) regression; inference; n = 500, p = 3
(b) classification; predict; n = 20, p = 13
(c) regression; predict; n = 366/4= 91; p = 3
